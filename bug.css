The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentage values in nested elements.  For example, I have a container with a width of 50%, and inside, I have a child element that should take up 50% of the *container's* width, not the viewport width.  However, the child element is taking up 50% of the viewport width, ignoring the parent's width.  The unexpected behavior is that `calc(50% - 10px)` also exhibits this problem.
